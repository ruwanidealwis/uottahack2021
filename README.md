## Inspiration
The pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing mental health challenges. We took inspiration to make an app that can support the user when navigating daily life. As mental illnesses come in different shades, we wanted to make an app that can accommodate and at the same time, not overwhelm.

## About _**Check In**_
Through _Check In_, users can input reminders for drinking water, stretching, and getting enough sleep, all tasks that can get to be overwhelming in the current environment. Users can also access a series of resources tailored to their current emotional state through the 'How are you feeling?' portal. They will be suggested to choose among five emotional states: 

* I am feeling anxious.
* I am feeling depressed.
* I am feeling angry.
* I am feeling overwhelmed.
* I am okay!

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for Check In
These are the features we hope to implement as we continue working on _Check In_:
* Providing users with the option to connect their Spotify accounts, so _Check In_ can recommend songs and playlists that match their mood. The music will be filtered according to tone, beats per minute, key, volume, pitch, and cadence.
